New in 2.0.0:

  - Websocket client
  - API has changed and it's suggested to use the new API
    but the old API is still there for backward compatibility
  - Increased Performance
  - Used types instead of just void at several places
  - Minor Bugs fixed
  - Builds now with -Wall, -Wextra and -Wpedantic
  - Changed compiler standard from GNU99 to GNU11
    but will still build with GNU99
